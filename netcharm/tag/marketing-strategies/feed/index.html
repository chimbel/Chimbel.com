								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There is no doubt that video is important. According to the latest marketing statistics of 2018, one-third of the people are spending their time watching video content online. The number of businesses that use video as a marketing tool has gone up from 63% in 2017 to 81% in 2018 and 81% people actually got convinced to buy a product or service by watching brand videos. If you still haven’t considered using video as a tool to leverage your brand goals, now is the time that you actually consider. Here’s why: </p>



<p></p>



<p>•&nbsp; &nbsp; People tend to retain 65% of the information for a couple of days when it is visually appealing.</p>



<p>•&nbsp; &nbsp; As much as 70% of potential consumers prefer watching videos of a product rather than reading about it.</p>



<p>•&nbsp; &nbsp; Videos increase Organic engagement on Facebook.</p>



<p>•&nbsp; &nbsp; A video post earns 10 times more share than text and image posts combined.</p>



<p>•&nbsp; &nbsp; The vast majority of online digital marketers are incorporating video marketing strategies already.</p>



<p>•&nbsp; &nbsp; Companies using video marketing as a strategy have already witnessed:</p>



<p>&#8211; An increase of 27% in CTR (click-through rate)</p>



<p>&#8211; 40% increase in high web conversion rate</p>



<p>&#8211; 50% higher revenue growth than the companies who don’t opt for video marketing strategies.</p>



<h3><strong>Video Marketing and Benefits</strong></h3>



<p>If you aren’t aware of online video marketing and you need some kind of an update, we are here to guide you. Video marketing is not rocket science, but a practice of incorporating videos into your marketing strategy for better awareness and brand recognition. Many people have a notion that video marketing is expensive, irrelevant or complicated. But it’s not! It is as simple as recording a video from your smartphone, adding a piece of music and your company logo.</p>



<p>You have been exposed to the world of video marketing but you haven’t just realized it. Ever observed the sponsored videos that pop up in your live social media feeds? Have you ever received any email newsletters with videos in it? What about the videos embedded on the home pages of a website or blog posts? These are all the examples of video marketing that you go through every day without realizing much. However, as a business, you can’t be a spectator in the marketing game and if you want to really grow as a brand, increase your conversion rates, impressions or views – then you need to up your game and get into creating video marketing strategies for yourself!</p>



<p>Video marketing is very much beneficial other than being a source of entertainment. As a potential customer, it would be really boring to read a long page of textual content without any visual representation for it. You would rather watch a smartphone review than reading about it. Watching videos about a product or services with animated content is more fun than actually reading blogs or articles. Some of the benefits of video marketing include as follows:</p>
