<h3><strong>Video Marketing and Benefits</strong></h3>



<p>If you aren’t aware of online video marketing and you need some kind of an update, we are here to guide you. Video marketing is not rocket science, but a practice of incorporating videos into your marketing strategy for better awareness and brand recognition. Many people have a notion that video marketing is expensive, irrelevant or complicated. But it’s not! It is as simple as recording a video from your smartphone, adding a piece of music and your company logo.</p>



<p>You have been exposed to the world of video marketing but you haven’t just realized it. Ever observed the sponsored videos that pop up in your live social media feeds? Have you ever received any email newsletters with videos in it? What about the videos embedded on the home pages of a website or blog posts? These are all the examples of video marketing that you go through every day without realizing much. However, as a business, you can’t be a spectator in the marketing game and if you want to really grow as a brand, increase your conversion rates, impressions or views – then you need to up your game and get into creating video marketing strategies for yourself!</p>



<p>Video marketing is very much beneficial other than being a source of entertainment. As a potential customer, it would be really boring to read a long page of textual content without any visual representation for it. You would rather watch a smartphone review than reading about it. Watching videos about a product or services with animated content is more fun than actually reading blogs or articles. Some of the benefits of video marketing include as follows:</p>



<p><strong>1. Videos build Trust and Confidence</strong></p>



<p>Building a trust factor is the best thing possible through video marketing strategies. It helps a lot to gain trust within the digital pool of existing customers, potential clients, and prospective employee candidates. There should be a video marketing funnel that needs to be implemented and at the top of the funnel, there should be types of videos that should introduce your company, services or products and help to solve a longing problem.</p>



<p>Below are the following types of videos that help to build trust:</p>



<ul><li>Customer Testimonials</li><li>Product Reviews</li><li>Case Studies&nbsp;</li><li>Expert Reviews</li></ul>



<p>A positive customer review about a hotel, an industry technical expert giving reviews about a product or services, giving your viewers a glimpse of brand influencers who make up your company can help to create emotional engagement and eventually gain trust.</p>



<p><strong>2. Videos help to Increase Brand Awareness</strong></p>



<p>Positive videos help your company to gain brand awareness and recognition. Also, if your company is a top-of-mind solution provider to the problems of a consumer your job is half done. Sharing positive experiences or testimonials of consumers through videos can associate your company with good brand recognition and awareness.</p>



<p><strong>3. Conversion Rates are High</strong></p>



<p>According to recent market researchers, it is estimated that 74% of people buy a product after they watch an explainer video. Interesting right? And landing pages with videos boost conversion rates by 80%.</p>



<p>Now, these are some solid numbers and even Google couldn’t agree more. Even Google is betting high with the success of videos ads by claiming that YouTube ads are generating conversions as good as 150% year after year. With that rate of success, you should consider testing YouTube ads for your own business, brands or services. Through videos, you can explain various scenarios like breaking down a complicated process, how a product or feature works, how to contact your business or company and many other clients or consumer solutions through illustrations.</p>



<p><strong>4.&nbsp;Better ROI</strong></p>



<p>In the earlier days, shooting, editing and producing videos was a tedious and expensive task. Many marketers were against it due to the heavy expenses they had to take care off. However, that’s not the case now. It’s pretty much easy to actually shoot and upload a video with smartphones and more accessible or cheaper apps. Many people are open to being both behind and in front of the camera. People are making it a career by calling themselves ‘YouTubers’ or ‘Vlogge Since making videos are very much pocket-friendly, the ROI is also potentially higher. As video marketing is gaining momentum, 51 percent of digital marketers today prefer video content as a marketing strategy with the best ROI.</p>

<p>A customer testimonial or a product review conveyed through a video can help to boost customer engagement. Watching videos about improving a product or service or getting a problem solved is more believable than actually reading an article about it. A video content attracts more share, comment, embeds, likes or engagement than any other written blog or social post by 10 times.</p>
