Even if a potential customer is walking by your restaurant, their eyes would be stuck to their phone screens in search of potential dining options.

<p>Social Media is one of the most emerging ways to gauge eyeballs with more than 1.5 billion registered users on Facebook. Social Media makes more sense for your restaurant digital marketing goals. There is a list of activities for online restaurant marketing:-</p>



<ul><li><strong>Online Reputation Management</strong> 
Customer Engagement online across social media platforms is an absolute necessity. You must be responsible for responding to tweets, comments or posts. You can also get social media managing tools online that allow you to manage all your social channels in one place. Your tweets and posts can be scheduled in advance to maintain consistency. The visibility of your restaurant depends upon visibility; so, maintain a frequency in your posts. Don’t post randomly with huge scheduling gaps between your posts. This might turn off your loyal followers and custome Try posting something weekly, if not every day.

</li><li><strong>Video Marketing
</strong>Videos play an important role as far as digital marketing is concerned. Videos can be visually informative, more share-worthy and fun to watch. The more your videos are shared, the visibility of your restaurant improves as more and more people keep on sharing. You can create videos of your infrastructure, kitchen staff, hospitality services, customer testimonials, the party life, and food.&nbsp; YouTube is the best platform for marketing long duration videos. Facebook and Instagram are good for short and concise video marketing where the audiences only wish to see small clips. You can tag certain people and ask them to share it.

</li><li><strong>Run Contest and Campaigns
</strong>Running contests and campaigns on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram or Twitter can give you a good boost in terms of reach. You can always conduct a check-in campaign or you can start tagging of pictures and this way, you can be visible to the people beyond your loyal custome It can help you to get in touch with your potential customers other than your target audience.

</li><li><strong>Paid Ads</strong>
