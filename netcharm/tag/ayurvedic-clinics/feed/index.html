<p>Do you sell or manufacture ayurvedic products? Do you own or run an ayurvedic clinic or hospital? We are here to help you learn some strategies or tips of digital marketing for Ayurvedic products, hospitals and clinics.<br><br> The Ayurveda market place is growing big time and the sales of herbal products are going up steadily over the last decade. Due to such heavy incline of herbal product sales, the number of herbal product suppliers is growing as well. A robust ayurvedic marketing strategy is essential if you want to stand out in the market of ayurvedic products online. The strategy needs to include a number of digital marketing channels. Successful sale through online marketing of ayurvedic products is possible as many herbal product companies have attracted customers through online sales. The Internet has a major role in marketing Ayurveda and herbal products and services. According to Global Analysts, western markets are adopting the way of herbal products too. <br><br>Ayurveda has its roots in USA but is more of a lifestyle than treatment. Ayurveda has started making ways in the western market due to its comprehensive approach towards mental, emotional, physical and spiritual well-being. But as an ayurvedic company, brand, agency or agent dealing with Herbal and Ayurvedic products or services, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.netcharm.com/" target="_blank"> NetCharm Marketing</a> is the best online marketing agency to help you rank higher in search engines with industry standard traffic generating keywords. <br><br><strong>We focus on two sub-verticals of ayurvedic business:</strong></p>



<ol><li><strong>Ayurvedic Products</strong></li><li><strong>Ayurvedic Clinics/Hospitals</strong></li></ol>



<p> For Ayurvedic related businesses, there are certain digital marketing strategies that are applicable like any other type of business. Digital Marketing Strategies for Ayurvedic Products and Clinics are as follows: <br></p>



<p><strong>1. Create a Website</strong></p>



<p>For the best ayurvedic online presence a website is an absolute must in the long run. A website can also be described as the face of your business online. It is essential to build and promote a website for your brand because it is possible that someone else might create a website with your brand name. A website can help you to promote your products and services across social media platforms.</p>



<p><strong>2. Optimize for Mobile</strong></p>



<p>Mobile-friendliness is now considered as one of the major ranking factors for Google. Any business or website that is non-compliant for mobile optimization doesn’t stand a chance as mobile devices are the basic tools for web users these days. Nowadays most successful businesses are optimizing their online properties for smartphones and tablets. Always keep mobile in mind, while designing your business website and SEO strategy.</p>



<p>Although the internet marketing rules on mobile are the same, location is also a factor that is important. Create a store directory on your site or tools that points them to the nearest retailer selling your products, if your products are available across various retail locations.</p>



<p><strong>3. Business Listing</strong></p>



<p>Make sure your workplace, office or clinic is listed in Bing Business, Google Business or other business directories. Listing with Google and Bing Business is always free. If you want to increase your brand visibility, you can also consider listing in premium directories if you have a high budget. Contact us, if you are not well versed with business listings. We don’t charge you for this.</p>



<p><strong>4. Start Corresponding Newsletter</strong></p>



<p>In order to generate leads and build your reputation, a definite guide always comes handy. Once you have established a relationship with your customers, a regular email keeps it even merrier.&nbsp; Through regular email newsletters, you can always share the latest news and updates to your loyal customers. You can also inform them about the latest deals that are specially targeted towards them.</p>



<p>It is one of the first and most effective digital advertising strategies apart from being cheaper, faster and easier.&nbsp; Another advantage of email newsletters is that you can track them unlike direct email because it can be only sent to people who have willingly signed up. You can be damn sure that you are reaching people who actually want to connect with you.</p>



<p>Your email structure if structured accurately also allows the recipients to decide how often they hear from you. Some want daily emails about latest deals while others might want a monthly update. Giving your loyal customers a heads-up is always a good idea.</p>



<p><strong>5. Online Advertising</strong></p>



<p>Online advertising is the most accurate marketing strategy for ayurvedic businesses considering its product related. We were successful in creating a good brand value for one of our clients called ‘Bestveda’ through a series of digital marketing activities and online advertising platforms like Google Ads that made a huge impact for promoting their ayurvedic products and services.</p>



<p><strong>6. SEO Ranking</strong></p>



<p>Your website will fail to rank in Google Search Results if basic SEO elements are missing on your website. Always choose an experienced SEO company that will help you with technical SEO. We as a digital marketing agency  have been helping clients in the Ayurvedic field to improve their website ranking in search engine results via organic SEO. Your website can be penalized by Google if you implement wrong SEO strategies. This might cause huge damage to your online reputation and business profile.</p>



<p><strong>7. Active on Social Media</strong></p>



<p>Social Media costs less than Traditional advertising regardless of a healthy return on investment. Internet marketing for herbal products is usually carried out by ayurvedic businesses. Your loyal customers get involved in the process by sharing a news story, special sale, or other interesting content. This can result in reaching a larger audience than a traditional marketing campaign ever did.</p>



<p>If your social channels are regularly updated and the content is interesting and engaging, social media can be the best tool to build a loyal customer foundation. Always see to it that your content is relatable to the target audience. Ask for their valuable feedback and take some time to respond. If customers observe that you actually care about them as a brand, you will definitely be able to stand out from the crowd.</p>



<h3><strong>Basic Tips for Promoting Ayurvedic Products and Businesses Online</strong></h3>



<p>1. Choose the perfect blend of paid and organic promotions. It may not be the case for other business marketing strategies but as far as the best strategy for an ayurvedic company is concerned, it is best to opt for organic as well as paid campaigns.</p>



<p>2. Never feel shy to promote your ayurvedic products. Ayurvedic clients often feel shy to promote their business online. Some of the clients think that it is unethical to promote an ayurvedic medicine or clinic. Don’t be shy if your product or service is of high quality. A worthy and trusted digital marketing company will help you to reach out to the right target audience and let them know your products.</p>



<p>3. Make sure that you publish your research and clinical studies. If there are any legal documentation or research theories for your products, publish them on your website. It can really boost the trust factor amongst your clients and potential clients. Hire a clinical researcher to create a documented clinical report.</p>



<p>4. Collect testimonials from your happy patients or customers, whenever possible, in a digital format. Always ask your client to give feedback via email with photographs. Display such testimonials on your ayurvedic website so that it improves the trust level of your business. Video testimonials ranging up to a minute can also do wonders for your business.</p>



<p>5. Request your clients to rate or review your business. It is essential to get rated on Facebook Locations or Google Business. You can always ask your client to review your ayurvedic business publicly.&nbsp; Apart from increasing the trust factor your business will rank better in search results. Higher ratings impact the ranking factors of the business listing.</p>



<p>6. It is always a good idea to hire a good digital marketing agency and take advantage of their expertise. A digital marketing agency can quickly start promoting your ayurvedic business online as they have an advantage of their expertise in the field. An experienced digital marketing agency won’t take much time in researching the perfect ayurvedic marketing strategy online.&nbsp; They are faster than you and can help you to allocate the proper money as and when required.</p>
